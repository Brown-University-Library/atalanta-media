Setting up OpenSeadragon on a Mac and using it without an image server

Step 1) 
Install [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) or [Command Line Tools for XCode](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/technotes/tn2339/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40014588-CH1-WHAT_IS_THE_COMMAND_LINE_TOOLS_PACKAGE_) so you can install Homebrew

Step 2)
Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), which will also include a copy of [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php)

Step 3) 
Download [MagickSlicer](https://github.com/VoidVolker/MagickSlicer), which requires ImageMagick

Step 4)
If you have high-resolution TIFF files, you will first need to export them to JPEG because MagickSlicer will not tile TIFFs. If you already have high-resolution JPEGs, skip to Step 5

To convert your TIFF files to JPEG, open the first TIFF in Photoshop
In Photoshop, go to File > Scripts > Image Processor
In part 1, select the source folder where your TIFFs are located
In part 2, select the destination folder where you would like to keep your exported JPEGs
In part 3, select the Save as JPEG checkbox, the preferred image quality (I use 10—12), and the convert profile to sRGB checkbox
In part 4, keep the Include ICC Profile selected
Then click Run to process all the files in your source folder


Step 5)
To use MagickSlicer, cd to the MagickSlicer-master folder and enter the following command in Terminal

	``` ./magick-slicer.sh -i path/to/source-folder/name-of-file.jpg -o path/to/destination-folder/name-of-file ```
	

	- or, if you're keeping the output in the same directory as the MagickSlicer script
	
	``` ./magick-slicer.sh path/to/source-folder/name-of-file.jpg ```


	- or, if you want to process all of the images at once, use the following commands in Terminal to get the conversion script to loop through all of the files in the source folder

	```
	myArray=(path/to/source-folder/*)

	for ((i=0; i<${#myArray[@]}; i++)); do ./magick-slicer.sh -i "${myArray[$i]}" -o path/to/destination-folder/name-of-file"$i"; done
	```


	- Note: each image takes ~30 seconds to process

Step 5)
	In the output folder (in our case, pageView or bookView), you’ll find a filename.dzi file and a filename_files folder of image tiles for your image

Step 6)
	Install [OpenSeadragon](https://openseadragon.github.io/#download)

Step 7)
	Create a new project. For now, we reference the image tiles files and .dzi file through Github ( see [pageView.json](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/atalanta-code/blob/master/data/json/pageView.json) and [bookView.json](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/atalanta-code/blob/master/data/json/bookView.json) )
